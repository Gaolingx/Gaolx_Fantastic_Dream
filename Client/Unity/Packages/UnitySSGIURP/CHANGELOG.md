- Improved the quality of SSGI across different resolution scales.


## [1.0.10] - 2024-09-05

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the SSGI quality did not match the volume override when denoising was disabled.


## [1.0.9] - 2024-09-02

### Added

- Added **High Quality Upscaling** option to re-enable the previous upscaling method.
- Added **Artistic Overrides** header to the **Indirect Diffuse Lighting Multiplier** property.

### Changed

- Improved SSGI performance by reducing arithmetic and texture sampling operations.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue with incorrect depth precision on mobile platforms.
- Fixed an issue where a temporary camera texture did not follow URP render scale.


## [1.0.8] - 2024-08-30

### Added

- Added three global shader keywords to indicate the state of resources created by SSGI:
  - `SSGI_RENDER_GBUFFER`

## [1.0.6] - 2024-08-29

### Changed

- Changed the **Indirect Diffuse Lighting Multiplier** property type to always visible.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where deferred shader variants were stripped by URP 14 during the build.
- Fixed an issue with SSGI on mobile devices.


## [1.0.5] - 2024-08-01

### Changed

- Changed shader includes from absolute paths to relative paths to avoid potential issues in certain situations.


## [1.0.4] - 2024-07-17

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where previous camera color texture was not released.


## [1.0.3] - 2024-07-17

### Added

- Implemented infinite bounce indirect lighting using the previous camera color texture.
- Enhanced aggressive denoising mode by adding **Poisson Disk Recurrent Denoising**.

### Changed

- Improved the pre-denoising logic to achieve more stable results.


## [1.0.2] - 2024-07-14

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue from URP where motion vectors in scene view were incorrectly rendered in Unity 2022 & 2023.
- Fixed an issue where previous depth texture was incorrectly set as the current one, causing severe ghosting.
- Fixed an issue where textures may not be set when Render Graph is enabled.
- Fixed an issue with Automatic Thickness Mode.
- Fixed an issue with Indirect Diffuse Rendering Layers.
- Fixed an issue with incorrect surface normals when Accurate G-buffer Normals was enabled.
- Fixed an issue with random sampling direction being broken on platforms using half-precision floats.


## [1.0.1] - 2024-07-12

### Changed

- Increased minimum supported Unity version to 2022.3.35f1 (from 2022.3.0f1).
