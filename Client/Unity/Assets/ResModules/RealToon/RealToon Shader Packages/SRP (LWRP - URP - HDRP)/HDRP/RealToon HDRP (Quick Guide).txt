===========================================================

*The Directional lights in HDRP don't have bias option, means no requirements.
*For Punctual lights {Point and Spot lights} and Arealight do have "Near Plane" option, it is somewhat the same as "Bias".
still no requirements but adjust "Near Plane" if needed to balance.

1. Just change the "Reduce Shadow" option value, thats it.
