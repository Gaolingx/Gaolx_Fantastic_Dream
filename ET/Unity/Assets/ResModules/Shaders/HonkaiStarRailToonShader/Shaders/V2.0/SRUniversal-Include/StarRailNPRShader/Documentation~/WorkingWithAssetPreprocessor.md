# Working with asset preprocessor

The asset preprocessor can

- Automatically smooth the normals of character models and store them into tangents.
- Automatically process textures.

The path patterns of the assets that need preprocessing can be configured in `Project Settings/Honkai Star Rail/NPR Shader`. The default patterns are designed to align with the naming style of in-game assets.
